Thanks so much for your interest in contributing!

Whose Data? is an open source project, and we need people like you to help grow and improve it. If you want it to help make it easier for Canadians to find out who owns our data, there’s something you can do to contribute.

**First things first: please read the [Code of Conduct.](https://github.com/samanthaburton/whose_data/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** Maintaining a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate is absolutely essential. When you join, please respect the code of conduct in all interactions on and offline.

You should also have a look at the [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/samanthaburton/whose_data/issues/19), so you know where we're at in development.
