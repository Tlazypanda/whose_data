# Whose Data?
Whose Data? aims to make it easier for Canadians to answer key questions about who owns -- and what options we have to control -- data collected about us via common online (eg. social media platforms) and offline (eg. health records) activities.

## Welcome! Bienvenue! :wave::tada::star2:

Thank you for visiting the Whose Data? project repository.

This document (the README file) is the best place to get an overview of the project, and how to get involved.

**Please note that this is a new project, and lots more info is on the way!**

## What is this?

### The problem
Every day, we ‘like’ posts on social media, check apps to see when the next bus is coming, tap our credit cards, walk past security cameras... and the river of information generated and stored about us swells.

This data may be about me, but whose is it, really? What control over it and its use do I have? 

It’s time consuming and complicated for Canadians to find good information about who owns and uses data that is commonly collected about us -- and what options we have to take control of it.

And without a shared understanding, it’s hard to have informed discussions and make decisions about the way *we actually want* ownership and control of our data to work.

### The solution
Whose Data? aims to make it easier for Canadians to answer key questions about who owns -- and what options we have to control -- data collected about us via common online (eg. social media platforms) and offline (eg. health records) activities.

## Who are you?
Hi, I'm [Sam](https://www.samanthaburton.com)! I live in Toronto, and I’m fascinated by the influence of technology in my life and in my communities.

The idea for this project was born in 2017, when the discussion about the partnership between [Sidewalk Labs](https://www.sidewalklabs.com/) (owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company) and Toronto to develop a “[neighborhood built from the internet up](https://sidewalktoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sidewalk-Labs-Vision-Sections-of-RFP-Submission.pdf)” took off in earnest [in my city](https://torontoist.com/2017/10/civic-tech-list-questions-wed-like-sidewalk-labs-answer/) and [beyond](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/googles-guinea-pig-city/552932/). Many of the questions raised focused on privacy, data ownership, and control. 

Questions like:
>*Who will own/control/have access to the data that is captured by the sensors deployed in this project? 
>Under what terms will that data be shared? For whom and for what purposes?* 
>[(source)](https://torontoist.com/2017/10/civic-tech-list-questions-wed-like-sidewalk-labs-answer/)

I have these questions too. 

And I also keep getting distracted by another question: **who owns, controls, and has access to my data right now?**

The answer is frustratingly hard to find. So, I started Whose Data? as an attempt to help answer that question -- and make it easier for more Canadians to do the same.

## What do you need?
**You!** Any way you can contribute is welcome and appreciated. :pray:

If you want it to help make it easier for Canadians to find out who owns our data and how we can control the ways it’s used (or not), Whose Data? can use your help.

I'm particularly looking for support with **writing**, **research**, **web design**, and **data visualization**.

In more specialized realms, it would be wonderful to have support from people with expertise in **data protection and privacy policy and/or law** -- especially in Canada. I also have ideas for a future phase of the project that would involve collaborating with UX or interaction designers and possibly illustrators.

**I’d also love your feedback along the way**, especially if you’re a concerned Canadian, journalist, advocate -- or all of the above! :maple_leaf:

## Get involved
If you'd like to help in any of the ways listed above -- or in any of the infinate ways I haven't thought of yet! -- then please check out the contributors' guidelines (coming soon) and the roadmap (coming soon).

Please note that maintaining a positive and supportive environment for everyone who wants to participate is absolutely essential. When you join, please respect the code of conduct (coming soon) in all interactions on and offline.

## Thank you! Merci! :purple_heart::heart::blue_heart::green_heart:
Thanks so much for visiting the Whose Data? project! I hope that you'll join the journey to make it easier for Canadians to understand who owns -- and what options we have to control -- our data.
